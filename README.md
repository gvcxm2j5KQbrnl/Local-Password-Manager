# Local Password Manager (LPM)

Local Password Manager (LPM) is a **simple, lightweight, and secure password manager** written in Python.  

It stores all your passwords **locally on your device in an encrypted file**, so your data never leaves your system and you stay in full control.

- Multiple users can share the same account while keeping their data **private**.  

### Features

- Export passwords securely when needed.
